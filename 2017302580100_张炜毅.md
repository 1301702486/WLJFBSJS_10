#### P12

  Because it is simple to provide complete path information detection from as to destination in BGP and loop - if BGP peer receives route as path containing its own as number, then using this route will lead to loop.

a) eBGP

b) iBGP

c) eBGP

d) iBGP

#### P20

  Because Z wants to transmit Y's traffic, Z will send routing ads to y in this way. In this way, when y has a datagram sent to an IP that can be reached through Z, y can choose to send the datagram through Z. However, if Z forwards routes to y, y can log those routes back to X. Therefore, in this case, Z cannot block the transmission from X to Z.
