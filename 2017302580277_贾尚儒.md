I choose P12 P14 P19

P12: 
The AS path attribute is used by the BGP to ensure no loops.The AS path lists all the AS Numbers that pass along the path, and since AS path is recognized AS a path to be followed, it is emphasized that you should never add your own AS Numbers to the path to prevent routing loops.



P14:

a) eBGP

b) iBGP

c) eBGP

d) iBGP



P19:

As for B, A should advise him two routes：AS-paths A-W and A-V. As for C, A should advise him only one route:A-V. Then C receives AS paths: B-A-W, B-A-V and A-V.
