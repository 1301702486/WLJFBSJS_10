### p14
a. eBGP

b. iBGP

c. eBGP

d. iBGP

### p15
a. I think it's I1 because this interface starts with the least cost path from 1d towards the gateway router 1c.

b. It would be I2, because it has known how to get to x. Both routers have equal AS-PATH but I2 begins the path that has the closest NEXT-HOP router. 

c. It must be I1 because it has the shortest AS-PATH.
