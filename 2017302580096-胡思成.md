# Assignment 10

### p14
a. eBGP

b. iBGP

c. eBGP

d. iBGP

### p15
a. I think it's I1 because this interface starts with the least cost path from 1d towards the gateway router 1c.

b. It would be I2, because it has known how to get to x. Both routers have equal AS-PATH but I2 begins the path that has the closest NEXT-HOP router. 

c. It must be I1 because it has the shortest AS-PATH. 

### p16
One way to do this is C only publish the route to D from the peer point of C in east coast.

### p19
A would tell B A can only route to W and V, tell C A would only lead to V. C receives AS-PATH: 
B-A-W, B-A-V, A-V. 

### p20 
I think this cannot be reslized because Z wants to transit datagram from Y so it will advertise to Y that it can send datagram to z. in this case, y may re-advertise to X that y can transit datgram to Z, and X has known that it can transit datagram to Y, X can trasit datagram to Y and then to Z, the situation in the problem cannot be realized.
