# Homework 10

### Question 1

> **P14.** Consider the network shown below. Suppose AS3 and AS2 are running OSPF for their intra-AS routing protocol. Suppose AS1 and AS4 are running RIP for their intra-AS routing protocol. Suppose eBGP and iBGP are used for the inter-AS routing protocol. Initially suppose there is no physical link between AS2 and AS4.

> a. Router 3c learns about prefix x from which routing protocol: OSPF, RIP, eBGP, or iBGP?

>> **My Answer:**

>> Router 3c learns about prefix x from eBGP routing protocol.

> b. Router 3a learns about x from which routing protocol?

>> **My Answer:**

>> Router 3a learns about prefix x from iBGP routing protocol.

> c. Router 1c learns about x from which routing protocol?

>> **My Answer:**

>> Router 1c learns about prefix x from eBGP routing protocol.

> d. Router 1d learns about x from which routing protocol?

>> **My Answer:**

>> Router 1d learns about prefix x from iBGP routing protocol.

### Question 2

> **P15.** Referring to the previous problem, once router 1d learns about x it will put an entry (x, I) in its forwarding table.

> a. Will I be equal to I1 or I2 for this entry? Explain why in one sentence.

>> **My Answer:** 

>> I will be equal to I1, since I1 is the start of the least cost path from 1d to the gateway router 1c. 

> b. Now suppose that there is a physical link between AS2 and AS4, shown by the dotted line. Suppose router 1d learns that x is accessible via AS2 as well as via AS3. Will I be set to I1 or I2 ? Explain why in one sentence.

>> **My Answer:** 

>> I will be equal to I2, since AS2 AS4 and AS3 AS4 are of equal AS-PATH length, but I2 is the start of the lease cost path from 1d to the gateway router 1b.

> c. Now suppose there is another AS, called AS5, which lies on the path between AS2 and AS4 (not shown in diagram). Suppose router 1d learns that x is accessible via AS2 AS5 AS4 as well as via AS3 AS4. Will I be set to I1 or I2 ? Explain why in one sentence.

>> **My Answer:** 

>> I will be equal to I1, since AS2 AS5 AS4 has longer AS-PATH length than AS3 AS4, and I1 is the start of the lease cost path from 1d to the gateway router 1c.
